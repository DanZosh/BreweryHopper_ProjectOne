## Tests
Application uses at least two server-side APIs:
* Open Brewery DB
* Clearbit Logo API
* Here Maps
Application uses client-side storage to store persistent data: Stores brewery data from the user's city search.
Application doesn't use JS alerts, prompts, or confirms (uses modals instead): No alerts, prompts, or confirms used.
Application uses a CSS framework other than Bootstrap: Uses Materialize.
Application is interactive (accepts and responds to user input): User stores city data.
